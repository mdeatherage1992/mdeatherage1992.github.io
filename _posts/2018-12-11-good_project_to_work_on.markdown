If you are going to be interviewing for front-end jobs, you will start to notice a pattern in what they want to know from you. The most important thing that I have found is gridding data. They will provide an API for you to fetch from, and then you will have to take that information, grid/sort it, and provide a pathway to CRUD'ify the database that they have set forth for you.

This is a completely reasonable thing to ask, and I think that this is the big leagues for a lot of bootcamp grads who are just getting used to fetches to their own data, let alone someone elses. An example, Alpha Vantage API for financial data, is an Array of objects, with column headings in a separate part of the response. My own data from say a rails API would be a lot more simple, and if it wasn't...well I'd change it! That's not a luxury when you are using someone else's end point, so you should feel comfortable getting data and columns onto a grid in React very quickly. 

The gameplan should always be what is the data format, and what does the data format need to be. I would recommend React-Grid-Ag for your gridding. They have some guidelines as to what they will use, but you can setState and the information will autofill if you have it in the right format on a grid. 

This sounds incredibly rudimentary, but doing it in repetition will make you very comfortable with getting something rather impressive up quickly and efficiently. The difference that I have found between developers who are getting jobs and those who aren't is preparation and experience in different situations. In bootcamp it's not hard to shelter yourself from actual real-world code in favor of popsicle stick projects that give you the power, rather than having you contribute to the power. 

A project I am putting my React Apps on hold for is getting a great grid template going for whenever anyone asks me to grid data. This way I can have the scaffolding for a project done before they ask, and I'll have more time to focus on the nitty gritty aspects of bootstrap styling, etc. If you don't want to be in charge of how the endpoint comes to be, then you better be in charge of making that data look very nice on the other side. There are only 3 ways to contribute to code, back, front, or both. The key to front is having a good set of tools with you at all times just in case the need arises for something to get done quickly, especially as we are seeing more coding challenges pop up to evaluate candidates.
