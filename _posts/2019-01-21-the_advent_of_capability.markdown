I'm so excited to talk to you all again. It's already been 7 days since my last blog post, and I once again felt the need to provide my technical thoughts of the week. As I have been working on projects over the past 7 days, I started to hear this word over and over. Capability. That is not a standard you have been held to if you are in bootcamp, or even a Jr. job. Capability comes into play when the company point blank asks you can you build this from scratch. They don't want to wait for someone to learn the ropes. A lot of us don't shop at Ikea because we don't want to waste time with assembly. 

These companies just pay more money to have one of us come ready out of the box. Sure, Ikea is a great store and all, but the job market is a heck of a lot more like Amazon. Instantly, exactly what you want. Hosted application with the database, back-end,front-end of their choice. The application must be able to do anything. This must be done autonomously, as your co-workers are probably being paid more than you to create value with their fingers, not mouths. 

2019 is the year of capability and there are people on Fiverr who will do something better than what took you 4 months to learn... and sell it for $30. With so many options when it comes to getting projects done, you have to be the preferred choice because you have capabilities that others do not. Technical capabilities. So, what are they? What within coding do you do from scratch that could be considered commercial level? 

I don't have many projects that can fit that bill. When it comes to cyber security, hosting, payment processing; those are what will set you apart. Follow through in your work to create a web application that can actually do something right now. Each project I make now follows through on exactly what it was designed for. E-commerce apps aren't visited by running npm start. Databases companies use don't require rails s. You shouldn't make a person have to go through that either. The more you can do on your own, the more people will call you back. It will show in your work. If you look like a responsible person who can interpret and write the same stuff they do the moment you walk in, the job search becomes all that much closer to ending.
