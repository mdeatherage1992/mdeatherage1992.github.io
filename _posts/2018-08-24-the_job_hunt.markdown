As I begin to get towards the end of my time here at Flatiron, the true work begins. I have confronted the demons of my own technological ignorance, and now it is time to showcase my skills to potential employers. Although web development has become a true passion and hobby of mine, my reasoning for going into web development was focused entirely on how robust the job market is for it. 

In my prior roles in finance, there really wasn't a way to be considered for senior roles without 10-15 years of experience. Throughout my life, I have applied to at least 1,000+ jobs, and I have read countless job postings. The key difference between developer postings and non-binary skill postings was that the requirements were skill-based. If you can demonstrate that you are an *expert* at a certain skill they need, there was no reason you couldn't get the job. In Finance, skill is favored less than time. Those with time under their belt are favored over those who may be on top of the sales board, but have only been doing it for 3-5 years. Technology and the internet have given power to those who are truly talented, not just veterans of a certain craft. 

In my time applying to development roles, I have been unsuccessful. Whether junior or mid-tier developer roles, there has not been much interest. It is very funny to see someone's inbox during a bootcamp. If you're doing it correctly, you will be receiving countless emails that you are not good enough, all while you are trying to complete that next project/lab like a madman. Your email inbox is almost like your own personal trainer, a guy/girl who is just designed to make you question your choices at every step of the way. Even with a carefully crafted cover letter, I have been sent rejections within minutes of applying. 

If you have experienced what I have, it's what makes us bootcampers. I hope you still laugh when they say they need a college degree of C/C#, but you still apply. The reason we are bootcampers is because we are thick skinned. We were humble enough to know that we weren't prepared for the next generation of labor, and we wanted to be considered special in the job market. For those who haven't begun applying, this will be another wave of mental anguish that you will experience. Every day more companies will say no to you. Whether the position has been "cancelled", they have better candidates, or you flat out just aren't good enough; keep applying. Apply more. The internet gives us the freedom to ring that slot machine until it rings. I am confident, even with no proof, that the slot machine will hit the jackpot soon enough. 

As it gets closer to completion, I feel closer than ever to all those who have come before me. Not the puppy mill bootcampers who don't have to turn in assignments, but to you all. The Flatiron, Full Stack, Hack Reactor, a/A people. Those who have beaten themselves down over months and months, only to go through a guantlet of rejection on their way to salvation. I wish you the best of luck as you go through this, and from one unemployed dreamer to another: KEEP APPLYING.
