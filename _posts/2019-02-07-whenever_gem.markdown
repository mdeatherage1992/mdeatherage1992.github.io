Hope all is well in the world of boot camping or former bootcamping. Matt here for another normally scheduled analysis of the technical job market. As we all know, the bar has been set much higher in 2019 for software developers coming out of a bootcamp. Thousands and thousands of kids flooded into the job market through these bootcamps, a lot of which only focused on one single thing, for example in Full Stack Academy they are all JS. I have gone against them in JS interviews and you can tell they are extremely comfortable inside JS. If that same student came across me in a Ruby interview it's a different story, but there are many schools of thought as to how broad a net one should cast when they are just starting out. 

The point of all of this heightened bar talk is that people need to be impressed by your work. Your experience is lacking, so what else admirable can you give to them other than a flourishing github? One of the gems that I think people can do that with is the Whenver gem. Rake tasks are very simple to use, and this gem allows you to set off Rake tasks at given times throughout the day, month, year. 

Why is this important? How many times do you get those dreadful spam emails? I am sure that is either the company paying another company a lot of money, or the company who set up some automatic things to happen. In my case, I had a credit-app that needed to charge interest monthly. I didn't want to set up monthly alarms on my phone to fire up localhost, so this Whenever gem is very powerful. It can make you look very strong without knowing much behind it.

I think of the techncial aspect of interviewing like a bear sniffing you. The bear is bigger (and smarter) than you. There is no question in that. He/she will most likely be disappointed you don't equal them in technical strength, but there is still that small chance that you will provide enough to be considered. I still to this day have yet to get a Jr interview so I don't know how those go. But a mid-level/senior job? You better come ready to fight a bear in a variety of ways, one of which is talking about a project or two that the bear steps back and goes, "wait, so how did you do it?"


Get some more interviews, get some better projects, I wish us both the best of luck.
