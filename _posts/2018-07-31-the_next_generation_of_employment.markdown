As I have been trudging along in this bootcamp, there is plenty of time to step back and think why you're here. When stuck on a pesky spec/lab, it's easy to let your mind wander to your first decision to become a software developer. For me, I was a salesman. Never in my life did I think that I would be sititng here typing away on a keyboard in trade school even 5 months ago. My job was going well, I had an income higher than what is offered after bootcamp, and there were prospects for growth. So what was so bad that I made such a drastic change?

If I had started my career 20 years ago, I would still be working the job that I had previously. As a financial advisor, my clients wouldn't have any other choice but to call up someone like me to manage their money, because the internet didn't exist. It would cost them about 2% of their money each year, and that was the deal that was made between the financial services community and the public. 

The internet changed everything. The public can now buy exactly what I do on their own, at a fraction of the minimum cost that I would be allowed to charge them. When there is a competitor out there offering so much for so little, it makes you question what exactly your value is, and why clients should pay exponentially more for having you at the end of the line.

I couldn't come up with an answer to that question. A simple Google search on asset allocation would allow anyone with under $3,000,000 to manage their money prudently with internet providers. I couldn't dilude myself into thinking that I was special at what I did. Why? I didn't have a crystal ball to know what was going to happen every given year in the stock market. Fancy titles were earned through bringing money in, not managing it effectively. Tests and certifications were used as bargaining chips for salaries rather than for actual insight into being better at managing wealth. The only truly remarkable money managers through the years with above market returns turned out to be ponzi schemes. If there was truly someone who could beat the stock market consistently each year, I promise you, you would know their name. 

The more I looked around, the more I saw "empty" jobs. People have not yet started to think of the internet as being anything other than a tool to browse Wikiepdia or see their friends vacation photos. It is my belief that the internet will become a vicious competitor to almost every job in our lifetime. Self-driving trucks alone would dessimate 15% of the American workforce. Sales, Analytics, Accounting; you name the job function, there are technology providers working right this moment to kick you out of your job. There is a Google bot that can call and set appointments with a human, and the human doesn't even notice it's bot on the other line. We aren't passing Turing tests yet, but we are getting very close. 

So what makes you valuable? What can you proveably do that the internet can't? "I'm a hard worker" doesn't cut it anymore.  The internet works harder than you. 90% of college majors don't provide you with anything other than a very expensive piece of paper after 4 years. Theoretical knowledge on solar panels and market research doesn't make me any more special than the other 100,000 people who graduate with the same thing each year. It took a lot of humility to admit that I wasn't any different than those around me, but it put me in the position I am in right now. Coding jobs are all over the internet, with people desperate to find the construction workers of the 21st century. You will have to prove your worth in the internet age, and I believe this is the best possible place to start. Because once the wave starts, it's not stopping.
