Well hey there folks! I am glad that I enticed you into another round of the Reactathon that I have been having after I graduated from Flatiron. As a refresher, I intend to recycle all of my Flatiron projects off my resume before New Years Day. That's a completely resonable goal, and I am well on my way to doing that. The React projects specifically are to be a linear progression over 5 apps, all of which have a specific industry focus, and componentry that would be specific to that industry. I don't have skills for the 5th project just yet, so my beginning projects will be a little bit more simplified compared to the final, which will most likely need to utilize Redux for a great few amount of reduced actions. 

I have completed my first, then I got bushwhacked by about 3 coding tests that take hours and hours to complete. Although it is important to keep a consistent schedule, you need to change it on a moments notice, and instantly prioritize the things you are doing. For bootcamp grads; if the bootcamp got the desired effect, then you are having trouble between coding and applying. Both of these are huge time investments, one of which yields next to  no success or value other than the distant shot of you getting a job applying online. But, you still have to do it, and do it a lot. Other than coding tests and applying the only thing else you should be doing with your time is building out big time projects. 

What is a big time project? Hm... an example. Expedia.com. Airbnb. Clone it. Re-create everything within the website as close as you possibly can, and rest assured a company would find a spot for you on their development team. On the whole, companies look for people who can make them money the moment they walk in the door. If you can show them that you are capable of doing their whole website, I mean... what COULDNT you do?!

Number 2 in the app series will cover traveling. I want to use the pieces I built out in my prior project to build out a fully functioning travel webiste, complete with booking, payment, the whole 9. I am unsure just how much I can actually do without having to get Shopify, but I will build out the most in my capability. The outline is as follows: 

Database Structure
// Users (username, password) has many bookings
// Places has many Users through Bookings 
// Hotels belongs to booking
// Flights belongs to booking 
// Bookings Belongs to User (Seeding database with bookings to mimic full hotels.

Rails API 
// Post request travel bookings to be entered into DB  
// Get Request to showcase the most popular places on the home page
// Secure handling of payment information
// Email confirmations
// Authentication of Users

React 
// Index Page 
// Travel search and book
// show pages of different popular destinations
// show pages of popular hotels


This is a big project, with a lot of moving parts. A lot of us really haven't been tested thoroughly in database relationships, so this will be one where I am adding complexity to a pretty high level, with sub-sections of hotels/flights being particularly tricky. Either or, this is a good place to check out, and get back to work. Good luck to all who are attending the career event.
