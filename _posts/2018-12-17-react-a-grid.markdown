Has it been another week already? I was just starting to wonder the next time I would get to write a blog was! This week has been like many other weeks, with ups and downs. I hope all of you are getting your resumes in the door at companies, but one has to be very keen on the types of jobs that all of us would be applicable for. Ruby is not popular, did anyone else notice that?! Except for a couple trendy companies in Colorado and maybe San Fran, I have noticed little to no Ruby positions...with the result being my career fair was focused on Java(??). 

I am not dabbling in those waters. Going the back end route opens me up for the holes that are undoubtedly in my sorting and algorithmic knowledge. Trust a fellow bootcamper, I've gone down the rabbit hole of spinning up Django APIs and Java EE APIs...I laughed to myself as I was trying to accomplish something without just unleashing a gem to do it for me. 

These blog posts are a requirement, and the requirement is to talk about what's on your coding mind. What's on my coding mind is React. A finite framework that has probably the most simplistic technical interview. If you know and understand React/Redux, there are jobs that will 100% hire you. None of my Ruby interviews ever got back to me on my technical assessments which I know I completed. I think with Ruby, they will take a guy with no Ruby and 3 years of Java over someone having full-stack Ruby Apps. Makes sense, I guess. 

React, different ball game. When someone asks you "What do you like most about ES6?" I almost take that as how much do you love React. React utilizes almost all the best practices of ES6 within it's framework (classes, arrow functions, let, etc.) and compared to other frameworks, it's incredibly simple. I spent last week trying to learn Vuex, and React has never spit an error "expected 6 indents, got 4"...70 TIMES. ya, ya, ya, change the eslint.js file right? Not only is that my grievance but there is no equivalent to "create-react-app". Open source is great but I think Vue is exposed to open source where a Vue app doesnt have a set in stone package that isn't being pulled every which way by developer a-la-carte dependencies that often times hate each other. 

Either or, I am babbling. If you were thinking of a specialization, you really should look into React. Had I only just had a bootcamp in React and JavaScript I would be able to get the jobs I am not getting now. I spent way too much time on a magic language that no one uses. I would love to use Ruby in my real life, but no one hires for it. So either I need to be a JavaScript soldier or teach me Java. 

Whatever...that's the part where you guys will need to catch up for front-end positions. Angular Apps // React Apps with API interaction along with the knowledge to offload on the phone, that's what I wish I knew before I started. Why did I call this React-a-Grid? MAKE A GRID TEMPLATE. And then send it to me, of course. All companies ask for you to grid fetched API data. So...make a nice little snuggly nest for tha data, all while you use your time to show boat with some of that fancy NavBar bootstrap magic. 

Best of luck everyone.
