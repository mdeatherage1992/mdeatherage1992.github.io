Hi There!

Welcome to my page. My name is Matt Deatherage, and boy, do I have a story to tell you. The story begins in a suburb of New York City, in New Jersey. As the son of two finance professionals who were very successful in their respective careers, there was no question as to what career I was going to eventually go into as an adult. Even in the early years,  I remember thinking about things differently than the other kids. Everything, and I mean everything, was (and is) about money. How to attain it, how to grow it, and how to manage it. 

I wasn't like the other kids when it came to having fun. While they stayed inside and played video games, I was constantly traveling around the country playing ice hockey competitively. In my head, this was a worthy sacrifice instead of wasting my time playing Mario Kart. If I could just be good enough at this hockey thing, I could finally buy the gorgeous things that I had always wanted. Normal 12 year olds don't dream of big ranches in Texas filled with exotic animals, but I did. The thing I love the most in this world is freedom. Money buys freedom. I was going to stop at nothing to be free.

As time went on, friends knew not to call me to for play dates on weekends. By the time I was in middle school, I was waking up every single morning at 5:30AM to have a Canadian coach( drill sargeant) skate me until exhaustion before school. My mother then brought her sweaty, tired son to school. The business of Matt started very early.

I went to high school on the Canadian border in upstate New York. Instead of a traditional high school, I went to a school that focused solely on developing the hockey skills for getting into a top tier Division 1 hockey program. This was the real route to getting money playing hockey. As I got to my Junior year, I looked in the mirror. I was 5'10, 175, and nowhere near the size of the kids my age who were getting offers to play in Canada and in college. This investment was beginning to sour. 

By my graduation of high school, I moved on to another investment: bodybuilding. I figured with enough dedication, I could put on the muscle that wouldn't require me to be 6'4 like with hockey. I could potentially get a supplement sponsorship, and attain my freedom. The tunnel vision set in again. I didn't go out, I didn't drink; a very good combination for someone in college, right? The friends I had were what we called in boarding school, "Rent-a-Friends". If I had an off day at the gym, I would bring my meals into a party( I was a real hit sitting in the corner with my pasta!!), and leave at 12.

I went from 175 pounds to 225 pounds within 4 years. I was ready to compete. I won Mr. Teen New Jersey 2012, as well as placed highly in an open division with adults who had been competing for years. As some would think this was a great result, it was time to look in the mirror again. The bodybuilders who were making money were few and far between, not to mention the lifestyle was extremely unhealthy. I hung up the posing trunks, threw away the tanning oil...it was time for me to look for another investment for the business of Matt.

By the time I was close to graduating college, I had already been selling software to hedge funds for a start-up. I was the only person in the company to actually get physical money for the beta version product (which was eventually sold for parts), and I thoght that was sales was going to be the next ticket. The summer of my graduation, the Wolf of Wall Street had just come out. Barring the graphic scenes, it changed my life. Watching Leonardo Di Caprio call people on the phone and land thousands and thousands of dollars in munutes was all I thought about for months. I knew I needed to get in a role where I could make those cold calls, and receive the avalanche of commissions that came with a successful dial. I would be sitting on my ranch in no time.

I got a job as an investment salesman in Florida, selling mutual funds to investment advisors around the country. My job was to reach out, explain our product, and schedule meetings for a senior partner out in the field. I wasn't exactly closing business myself, but it was a start, right? After getting my Series 7 & 63, I was ready to dial! After 30-40 times of watching the Wolf, I was excited to finally try my skills. I will always remember that first day.

Voicemails. Over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. By the 100th dial, the writing was on the wall. This wasn't the 90's. People had the internet, so why would they pick up the phone? Even I didn't answer solicitation calls! I knew I could be a true warrior on the phone, but there needs to be a pulse on the other line for me to do so. I had to move to a position where the calls were warmer, and the commissions were direct. 

I worked as an investment advisor for a national branch of Morgan Stanley in Florida. In this role, people already had accounts, and my job was to sell them on making changes to those accounts (if it was in their best interest of course!). Rememer, this is Florida. The pace of work is more like a rascal scooter than a Ferrari. I don't run on ambition, I run on anger. I worked from 7:30AM - 7:30PM, making hundreds of calls to the people who I was assigned to. Within 4 months, I had already called all of my clients three times over. I was a top 10/90 in my role at 23 years old every single month I was there, competing against guys who had been working in finance longer than I was alive. My manager eventually told me I had to wait for people to call back, and that I would not be receiving any more new clients. Once again, this investment wasn't making much sense. 

I moved back to New Jersey, and began working as an investment advisor on my mothers team at Morgan Stanley. I was given a group of clients, but this was not a sales job. My job was to manage, not sell. Make sure their account information was updated, suggest changes, and keep the status quo. For someone like me, this was like taking a 3 pound benadryl every single day. Life was passing by. I wasn't going to let it, though. Every day I looked on realtor.com & horseproperties.net to keep my intensity high. I don't care whether it was Texas, Wyoming, Montana, I just wanted a big space of property, and a gate. Each night I went to sleep frustrated that I wasn't on my ranch. I knew I had to make a change.

I linked up with one of the few good friends I had from school, and we started making business after business. We bought a media website, we created a cryptocurrency that was the first to put FitBit data into an Ethereum Smart Contract, and I made a Google Chrome extension for mutual fund data. I even wrote a book on how to ICO with less than $50,000. These projects required massive amounts of funding that we didn't have, but I didn't care. For the first time in my life, I finally got to go at my pace. 

Through my businesses, I worked alot with developers. Freelancers, friends, colleagues. What they all had in common was they weren't risk takers. They didn't have project of their own, they wanted to be paid by contract for the work they did for others. I saw this is a great waste of a scarce talent. They sent a scope of work, we agreed, they were paid. After the 3rd or 4th time going through this process, it clicked. The builders are the sellers of the 21st century. The ones I worked with certainly werent, but the only way to truly make money in this country is to build something and sell it. No one is giving you a schedule, no one is declaring "you will make X amount this year", and no one is holding you back from being special. 


That is why I am here. To be special.


Anyone who decided to make a change like me is already a dear friend. Send me a message, I'd love to hear your story too.
