As I have said in other posts, React seems to be the one trigger word with companies where if they need it they will talk to you if you have it on your resume. I was seeing that the technical job market is not a "career potential" market. You jmust have the exact skills to basically do any job on the front-end or back-end with that distinct language/framework from scratch. And that's completely reasonable. If you want to continue to be in the industry with the most rapid appreciation of job value, you better be getting it right, 100% of the time. 

These Junior Developer / Junior this Junior is only your label because of experience, not knowledge. As everyone knows, by 2-3 years of working on a framework 365 days a year (You best be looking at code every day), you're going to be Senior/Lead -level good at your craft. Why not make sure to pick a good one? If the job market has no true room for incubation, then you should always go into an interview with the view of what is the investment in the craft itself.

My opinion is React. A potential of no page loads on a website, and a JAMstack-friendly place to work on Javascript, if you're like me and having a tough time of prioritizing and choosing what to build, my plan is this: Make 5 websites of React with different API communication with Django, Rails, CosmicJS, MongoDb, and... eh...probably another rails haha. Not set in stone, but the priority being I want to fill a resume with projects that anyone would be proud of, not someone who was doing this less than 6 months. 

The types of websites that I am building in React will be focused on a slideshow theme pageless load company websites. I will make them for 5 different industries. The industries I start with will be simple, then graduate to more complex / interactive. My first will be much worse than my 5th, so that's reason enough to do this, as well as it puts your resume in the shape for any front-end developer job. They see you can hook up your personal equipment into theirs through the back-end. You should be able to after those 5 projects. If you get those done, I am confident your React skills will be high-grade, especially for a position where you may not be desinging from scratch.

If anyone reads this, if you were interested in working on these projects, they could be taken down in the 5-6 grueling days. The React App would need to be templated for use throughout each full-stack project, but each with a distinct feature based on the industry. I'll do it with another person whose game.

Long story short: Don't be satisifed with your popsicle stick projects where you have one or two working components and the functionality isn't production ready. That's crap and you should know it. I want all prior projects to be "second page" projects within the near future. Pick a website and copy it with pageless/animated features with css, bootstrap, and the various NPM react features you can build on. You know what a good, working website looks like. Hold yourself to the exact standards of Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc. Anything less and you won't have a chance to keep pace with the way the job market is working right now. 

There's a formula. Record your steps in simple english on a word doc for a React App that's beautiful (first 2 will be tough obviously). Once they're ironed out, you just designed your first reason to be employed. The bar has been raised, so it has to be met. Interested? email me.
