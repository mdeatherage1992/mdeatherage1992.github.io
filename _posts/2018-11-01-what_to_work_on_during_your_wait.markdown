Whew! I got the congrats email, and your friend and fellow hopeful coder is done with the curriculum. Avi said it perfectly, "You're not done here". As many of you applying already know, graduated or non-graduated, it really doesn't matter. Your life is now a war. It is a war to get your resume looked at for more than 10 seconds, and for someone to see more than just words on a page. 

I wish I had a tally of just how many "NO" ' s I have gotten since I have started, certainly over 200. I have tried to remain positive about getting denied, but it sucks! Of course no one wants to be applying for Jr. roles and getting denied based on experience. Of course I have no experience, I am a junior! I think the frustration that many of us feel stems from not being able to be evaluated. I just want take their coding tests. I've gotten denied by companies that have at least done me the favor of giving me a test to take, and I appreciate the fact they look at my work critically, rather than simply deny me based on what where I've worked. 

But fret not, this will be not be a doom and gloom blog that I have grown so accustomed to writing. I've started thinking critically of how I spend my time during professiona exile. If you have looked at the job boards, it is pretty clear Ruby and Rails aren't as plentiful as Javascript, PHP, Java, an the other older language of yesteryear. 

This brings us to a crossroads. Of course, if you want a job, you may need to take a position where you are working on a language that is not as new as  what we have had the pleasure of working with at Flatiron. Based on my experience, I would suggest to focus on modern languages, as they provide you with something that you may not even be thinking of yet: contracts. 

The biggest hit on my resume has been React. I get countless emails from recruiters looking for someone with any React experience for contract based work that doesn't require you to commit to the company full-time. As an entrepreneur, those types of projects are why I quit my job to change careers in the first place. Being able to take a consultative approach with your interactions with companies offers you the freedom to stack on multiple jobs at once, and be sought after for your skills and skills alone. Full-time employment has many benefits, but at it's core it is very much like all other full-time jobs: inequitable. The amount of time you spend and work for a company is often not equally compensated. Showing up to a location // "clocking in" and sitting in the same place for over 2,000 hours is something that a lot of people take for granted. Your master crafts man/woman now, why not make sure you get the skills to be treated like one!?

That leads me to React. React is the pageless loading wonder-framework that many people seem to be working on/transitioning to. I am sure you're already frequently applying to React jobs, but make sure to look at it all jobs in the right scope. You've already taken a crazy leap of faith in switching careers from X to something with the word "engineering" involved...thats crazy! The risk has already been taken, make sure to really analyze the language the company wants you to work in. For exampe, there are 90K jobs to work with SQL. There are millions of people who know about / work with SQL on a daily basis. That doesn't sound too "nichey" to me. Maybe that's what you want though: constant,plentiful full-time job market. That's what my blog boils down to: Just make sure you ask yourself the questions that no one is going to understand enough / care enough to ask you. I am sure you've felt lonely on this journey, so always be the one who has your back. No one else will.
