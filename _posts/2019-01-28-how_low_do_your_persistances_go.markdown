Catchy Title right? Nice to check in with you on the suniest of mandatory occurrences. I came across something very interesting in my travels, so I will share it. Let's take a medical application. When someone goes into the hosptial, there is a form. The form has different sections with different questions. For example, a Medication Record will have symptoms targeted for relief, dosage, dosage, size, etc. Each one of those within themselves has their own little environment of information. In ruby speak, they are all models! That's alotta work. Think of all the things on an patient intake, and then think of how many models, tables, and migrations that has to be. 

Sounds long right? I agree! I worked on a project with big time data persistences, and the one thing I have to say is DO THEM. Once a form is submitted, if you can get the right cascading motions for the data to be poured in the right holes, that is a valuable skill. It takes time and effort, not to mention a ton of prys and loggings. But I think as time goes on you will start to notice what was not taught, which is scale. Scaled reactions to inputs. 

If you're thinking of a project, why not try to make a pokemon library. That's big, right? Even with only 150 entries think of the scale of data it is. Type, Powers, Color, Size, etc. Think of something with a tangible amount of variety, and try to work on something that could handle the variety. Being held to the standard of, "If I pour this data in will it spill or break?" is the way to get positions in technology. I am by no means an expert, but I do know that the more models and relationships established, the more high level the application is. Especially when there are  0 companies out there that have just simple data needs. 

Keep scaling out there friends of the keyboard. I hope you all are getting many opportunities in the new year so you won't continue to find yourself on a blog such as mine, although I do appreciate you stopping by.
