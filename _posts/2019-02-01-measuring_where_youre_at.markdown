Tough question for a lot of us. For those actively applying I am sure there is something that has stuck out to you as either a weakness or a reason why you may not be as successful in your search as you would like to be. The holes that someone with no 4 year degree has are immediately focused on during most of the interviews I have. An interview in React can easily turn into data structuring and sorting, and that was something I was unprepared for in the beginning of my search. There is no such thing as being technically sound in one area, but not the other. The computer science degree gives you the scope of the entire ecosystem of technology, and it's patterns. 

None of us (without comp sci degrees) have any experience in sorting, scaled data structuring, and the vernacular that comes with it. I was embarassed that someone asked me "Do you have any experience with typed languages?" and I had no idea what that meant. These are the silly little things that need to be covered up prior to an interivew. 

Have I found the secret recipe to cover those holes? Absolutely not. If you type interview questions for XYZ into Google, there are certainly questions to review, but most of the time these guys and gals will come up with questions off the top of their head about things that relate directly to their business. Another example, a turnery operator is a fancy word for one line functions. To engineering folks, words matter. I come from sales, so I try to slicken my way through something I am only 80% on, and they catch me every time. 

There are two types of interview processes for technical jobs. Project or interview based. The project based interviews behoove the people like us, as we get plenty of time to use the internet as reference to find the right answers. The projects are typically predatory, and I have certainly done commercial freelance work for someone under the guise of it being a job interview. With project based interviews, only do the ones that you think would be impressive for GitHub. It is not worth your time to spend time on something you'll never see again, none of us have any time to waste.

The question based interviews are from companies that I feel respect the developer a lot more, as they don't need much to figure out if you are who you say you are. I have yet to receive genuine feedback from a project based company, yet I usually receive feedback from phone interviews. The feedback is vague, and it's mostly "you don't know this well enough". They are probably right. 

I have yet to be seriously interviewed for a Junior Developer role, and I think there are a lot of you out there that are coming across the same. The only thing you can do is rise to the occassion, and get your project file to a mid-level engineers, and have the vernacular to back yourself up. I royally screwed myself but not having React jargon early on, but now it's evolved to knowing computer science concepts at a granular level. Was it what we were advertised? Absolutely not, but that's the hand that's dealt.

I wish you all the best of luck, and I hope we all crack the smile of success soon enough.
