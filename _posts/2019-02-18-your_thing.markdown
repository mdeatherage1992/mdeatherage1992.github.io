If you are reading this post, then chances are you still don't have a job, or are working towards getting one. If I could offer any advice is it is to find your thing your early. Ruby? Only Ruby positions, with Ruby project requests, etc. If you spread yourself out too thin, the depth of your knowledge will show very transparently. 

Take it from me, a person who still suffers from said affliction! I spread myself out as far as the eye could see to hit key words on job resumes, all for them to get on the phone with me and realize that I can just work on problems, and I am no true "scholar" of anything just yet. 

The strategy is two fold, learn the interview questions back and forth for the topic and make some projects in that topic or framework. Something from GitHub has to catch their eye for this all to work, so the more sophisticated the projects, the better chance you can get the interview. 

That interview question studying is designed to act as the glue, which is bound to fall apart. The key is to try to understand the family of question, so that you can utter something that hits a keyword in their head. We all know how much these folks love keywords, we can def. see them working with you on an answer.

Try to think of the thing that you thought you were best at, and get to stepping on that. I don't care where you are on your journey, if you found something broad enough for a career in development, focus on that. Getting in the door in our situatuation is difficult enough, you can maximize your chance if you're a super soluable solution for a start-up with a specific niche. I've never seen an old company asking for rails/react developers...

Whatever it is, keep at it. I don't know where you are in your journey but I am sure there are many times where the clock strikes another day where the wall hasn't come down. Mind you, there's like 400 walls behind it, but each wall has meaning, and a day it will come down. Or it won't?

Spiritual healing from your coding pal Matt, and on that word count... I'm out!
