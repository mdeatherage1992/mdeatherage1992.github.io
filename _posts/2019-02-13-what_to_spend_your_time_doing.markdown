Well hello! 

No matter what where you are in the job search, if you're there, how do you break down your day? What do you determine as success for each day that you are in the search? 

Unfortunately there is no right answer to that question. You can't prepare for phone interviews and project interviews at the same time. They require two very different skillsets, both of which take an equal amount of time to distinctly prepare for. 

I chose the project route, and wrote as fast as my fingers could type. They got me to into the doors of the companies that I wanted to be in. But, if they didn't send me a project to showcase my skillset and instead asked me theoretical questions, I looked like I had never coded in my life.

I am a salesman, and a salesman without his products is not a pleasant feeling, so I resorted to what I knew, which was getting to work and pushing out things that people may have not had the time to do for boiler plate technology stacks. 

There are two parts to being a master craftsman in software, and I have said this before on this blog: Physical and Theoretical. Physcial is "Give me the problem I'll come back with a solution"  Theoretical "Ask me what anything is and how anything works". 

The engineering folks from 4 year schools are excellent at theoretical (and most likely physical), and  we are good at physical. The theoretical is where you have people calling you every 2 weeks offering you more money than where you are. The reason we werent learning Haskell in bootcamp is because thinking functionally requires an excellent base in computer science reasoning and concepts. Objects are the entryway into programming, but one can't stop there.

There is a good population of people in bootcamps who are no joke in life, and they're in the trenches fighting it to be the last of those who are able to be successful in this format. I offer no advice to anyone in my position, as you know as well as I there is no advice in a market that behaves like this. For someone who is earlier than me, you can save much time if you review interview questions on everything. Just everything. Haskell, Elixir, Ruby, JavaScript, Angular...just read those. 

If you can't have an intelligent granular conversation on each part of the stack you're interviewing for, they will not move forward. These granular terms are not what we learned, and usually occur in commercial level applications which we have not seen. They are in the interview websites, and they can help landscape why someone is asking a certain thing, etc. 

Best of luck to all.
