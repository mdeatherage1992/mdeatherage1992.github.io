After 2 months of being out of Flatiron, I have learned more than I did when I came here fresh faced with basically no coding background. I had already been applying to jobs, and I was hitting walls when it came to my success. Some companies would reach out to me, but there was a feeling that they could see right through my thinly veiled wall of technical abilities. It was because of my projects. 

"Cracking the coding interview" sometimes can be cracked by avoiding it altogether. The resume is the way you get a job. Maybe the one off guy talking to his friends dads brothers cousin, but usually it comes down to: who is this person on paper. For all of us with no CS degrees, that paper better look pretty good. In coding, you can make your resume into a senior developer resume while you are still in Flatiron, you just have to know understand how a resume gets on someone's desk. 

If you use any application system, except for email, there is going to be a sort. Based on parsed keywords, your resume will either be flatly denied or put into different piles based on tier of relevance. The more keywords you hit, the more interviews you get. Flatiron gives you about 6-7 keywords. The minumum is 15-20 to get comfortably past the parsing for positions I have found. I am at around 12-13, and by no means am I finished. We are all way behind the 8ball. 

If I drummed up some concern, if you're unemployed, I should be. Being a bootcamper is not enough. When you make projects, you should go the full 9 yards with it. If you build rails // react like you did in school, you know the accessories that can go with a stack like that. People want to see the accessories! They want you to talk about the accessories, have opinions on accesories. Why develop un-usable projects? I had only unusuable, unscalable projects after graduating, and they all needed to be recycled with code that actually looked like okay this guy knows what a technology stack is, and is making every intention to make this look like a live fire exercise. Do I need to host my stuff? Of course not. But you better have the ingredients to do so if asked. 

This is a great great time to be a bootcamper. 2015? You mean when companies didn't mind hiring people right out of a bootcamp? Nah. 2019 marks a year where a lot of bootcampers will end up stopping altogether. Jobs are looking for more, and you need to give them more. If you get a job in 2019 as a bootcamp graduate, you earned that job, and the title that comes with it. I wish everyone the best of luck, and if you worked tirelessly to get to where you are now, do NOT settle. None of these $20/hour internships, or $45K Jr. jobs. If you want to avoid failure this year, start using that creative brain to get some big time projects on the board. Go far beyond what you're capable of, and get stuck. When Stack Overflow and MDN docs can't help you, that's when you know you're in creative territory.
