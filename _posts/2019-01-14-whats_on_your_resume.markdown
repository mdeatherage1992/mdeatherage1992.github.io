Televangelist title, right? Don't worry there is still gonna be some spiritual healing in this blog I feel the urge to write once every 7 days in. Okay, so I've bashed college for the lack of physical skills that I was provided during my 4 years.  I worked 2 financial services jobs whilst in school, so I could sell you stuff on the phone and work in Salesforce.com. Okay sure, that's more than most people graduate with, but I didn't have anything binary as to where someone could actually assess me and determine a price for my work. 

The technical market is a cold, cold place. I hope you are good enough to feel it's warmth, but during the early years it is a struggle when most companies are demanding immediate financial value from your fingers the moment you get into a job. That is a learning curve that people have to undertake before they get into the job for a variety of reasons; one of which is the HR person agreeing to talk to you for 15 minutes.

So then how does that start? Did you watch Food Inc. and simply not question where the employment sausage is made? KEYWORDS. Keywords, folks. What is your resume other than a large long list of keywords that software systems search to determine who can be sent directly to HR, who goes in the "purgatory", and who can be shown the virtual door before there is even a conversation. Okay, so this judgement is made on only one thing, which is, yup, the rezzy. 

We see all this flashy flash bullshit in the media, but I'll tell you right now I'd sell everything I own for some more keywords on my resume. There are people with no college education; barely any high school education; and technically speaking, they make my resume look like a child's. 

That's not only motivating, but also a strategic entry. Dont describe your daily activities in your previous non-tech jobs on your resume. Wasted lines. The Flatiron resume, in my humble opinion, is great. The tech project section is right smack in the middle. My job after graduating was expanding that section to where all my other stuff fell off the page.

So if I have made sense this far, if I read your palms, will they tell me all of the projects on your resume are Ruby// React/JQuery? That's 3 key words. Don't be wasting lines of precious resume space on duplicate genre github items, when you should be geting Java EE on there, or Postgres, Mongo, Django, AWS(not fun), and the list goes on. The way to do this. BOILERPLATES. 

No one used that keyword in this school! "django / react boilerplate github" search into google. You got yourself a precious connected back - front python app that you can gaze upon until you can use the docs yourself to craft something up. These new languages must be used for keyword depth in the you-dont-have-a-comp-sci-degree days. You don't get to say Java or C++ in the education section, so you have to say it in the project section. 

Best of luck as always. You get the struggle. Don't forget to keep struggling though.
