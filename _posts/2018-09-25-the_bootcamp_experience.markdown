Although I think many in the in-person bootcamps will rightfully say their experience was far more rigorous; those doing a bootcamp full-time understand the struggle of prioritizing things as time dwindles down at the Ultra Trade School. During bootcamp, little more was expected of you than to learn the fundamentals of programming, and begin to apply it. Then, almost instantly, you are expected to be able to program in a professional scale, and be able to have technical knowledge to get a position. 

If that is who you are, I wish there were more like you. The further we go in the course, the more rejection and faith-testing events take place. I for one receive probably 10-15 rejection emails per day. My Birthday was yesterday, they took it easy on me with only 5! So we add this professional rejection with technical rejection when new concepts are introduced that are completely foreign to your brain just weeks ago. I remember being asked a technical question about what my favorite part of HTML5 was. I started laughing. My favorite part of HTML5? Oh you mean the thing I have been taking for granted as always awesome was once not as awesome? Hm, sorry, I couldn't tell you. 

How many of those in other careers ever have to face rejection? Now how about how many have to ever face the rejection the size of a bootcamp graduate who is job-seeking? 

There is no other way to describe this experience as anything other than a pure gauntlet. I was a college graduate from a major university, and the way I have been challenged in this coursework is like nothing I have experienced in my 25 years on this earth. Knowing you are not smart is almost a pre-requisite to being successful as a bootcamper. The humility it takes to learn a subject where each word of a description is important, and moving on from topics you'll need years to delve into to become truly knowledgeable. 

Then, package all of this information and application, and keep that package handy in your brain for technical interviews, and get out there. 

You're brave, let's face it. That takes guts to do, and it takes a lot of humility coming from where we come from. We are competing against 4 year comp-sci college grads for jobs, and we are *confident*. The confidence we show in something that takes others a whole degree's worth of time is why we get the jobs, certainly not because of the nuts and bolts. 

In a world of fleeting attention spans and dwindling personal reconigitions, make sure to schedule some time after your journey to reflect on what you accomplished. Others won't. Other people won't know what an inbox full of rejection and a brain full of doubt feels like. It brought you to the core of society, where you're only as good as what you can provide. That's a really great place to be coming from at a time like this.
